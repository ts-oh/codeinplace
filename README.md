## Hello!

**Purpose:**
This was a final project for Stanford University Code in Place 2021.

**Description:**
I wanted to create something small and humble that I could use everyday. I'm a coffee enthusiast and calculating brew ratio is important to me. Rather than using a calculator every-time, I tried to apply my CIP learning by creating a brew ratio calculator by using python and running it from the terminal. I hope to have it running as a web app in the future where I can just bookmark the page in my browser.

Thank you for reading!
